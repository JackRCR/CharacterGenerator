Purpose of this program thus far has been trying to ease the burden on generation of characters by users of L&T/AD&D.  
The individual procedures that result in stats are one thing, but also presenting all the decisions and choices are quite another.
The scope of this project is thus increasing, to become more than just a single main class, and instead take on the basics of a Character Manager.  
Or at least provide some integration with that project.

Key restrictions:
At present this only can generate PLAYER races and classed characters.  It is not build to handle anything else, in any more flexible of a manner.
